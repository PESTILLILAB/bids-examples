This example dataset aims to showcase the different use cases supported by `BIDS Atlas`, ie [BEP038](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxW4cARr3-EiBEcXjLpSIVidvnUSHE7yJCUY91i5TfM/edit?usp=sharing) and thus also evaluating and testing the proposed changes to the specification. 

Only the imaging files, ie `*.nii.gz` have been truncated to `0 bytes`, while all other files, ie the `.tsv` `LookUpTables` and `JSON` metadata are provided in full. 

# BIDS Atlas use cases and respective atlases

In order to cover the use cases of this `BEP`, the dataset at hand entails multiple `atlases` as indicated below.
`Atlases` are utilized in `BIDS-Atlas` in **two general ways**: as `DataSet` of type `atlas` in case an atlas (or multiple) is provided solely and as-is and within a `DataSet` of type `raw` or `derivative`. In the latter case, `non-altered`/`original` `atlases` are stored at `BIDS root` and `altered`/`derived`/`applied` `atlases` are stored under `derivatives`.

## Atlas-within-dataset - atlas transformed to template space

The example provided here refers to "atlas-within-dataset" use case, specifically use cases where an `atlas` is transformed to a template space.
